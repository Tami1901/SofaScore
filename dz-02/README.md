# Homework 2 - SofaScore Frontend Academy

Homework 2 is simple. Pass all tests (Or as many as you can).

Test are composed for you to explore some JavaScript nuances and to explore common syntax constructions that will be used in later lessons.

## Instructions

NOTE: You should only modify `solutions.js` file, **do not modify** `solutions.test.js` file üòÄ

1. Copy `homework/02` directory to your git repository.

2. Position yourself (via terminal) into copied folder. You will know you are on the right place if you can see `package.json` file with name property `homework-02`.

3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies ([Jest testing framework ](https://jestjs.io/)).

Jest is the best (personal opinion ‚ö†Ô∏è) JavaScript testing framework. It has simple out of the bag configuration and it is commonly used with React.

4. Modify `solutions.js` to pass tests.

Use `npm run test:watch` or `yarn test:watch` to run tests in watch mode.

Watch mode will ensure that test are re-run on every change made to solutions or tests (tests are fine, don't change them).

There is also `test` command available. This command will run tests and finish, so it should be manually re-run every time. I will use this command when reviewing your pull requests üòâ.

## Submitting Solutions

Similarly to Homework 1, solutions should be submitted via your GitHub repository.

Open new branch with Homework 2 in it.

When homework is finished open Pull Request and request my review.

I will then review your code and approve it, or request further changes. This review process is designed to be iterative as every real PR, so your code can be review more then once if there are some changes. Use this to your advantage.

## Extra Information

If you feel stuck feel free to contact me for further explanation, some functions are maybe little trickier than others, so don't beat yourself too much if you get stuck.
